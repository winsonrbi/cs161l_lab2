Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
Logic Distribution:
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:       0 out of       0   0%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of       0   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                 32 out of     108   29%

Peak Memory Usage:  732 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  1 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:43 - No license file was found in the standard Xilinx license
directory.
WARNING:Security:44 - Since no license file was found,
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:50 - The XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is set to
'2100@elguapo.cs.ucr.edu'.
INFO:Security:53 - The LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is not set.
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s100e' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network clk has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 39 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   rst,
   opcode,

   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
